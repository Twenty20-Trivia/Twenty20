## 📚 User Stories

1. As a user, I want to be submerged in strange facts about the year 2020. I want to play a trivia game so that I can pass the time and be entertained.
2. As a user, I want to be witnessed! I should be able to input my name and have the game keep track of my score during my visit.
3. As a user, I want to have my accessibility needs considered. I want to interact with a platform that considers contrast, sound, image descriptions / screen reader: readable content etc.
4. As a user, I want an interface that's easy to navigate and to understand so my valuable time is not wasted.
5. As a user, I would like to be able to control when my answer is submitted and not have it done automatically, this ability will allow me to change my question should I decide to change my mind about my initial response.

### [Array.prototype.sort()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort) - *Developer Mozilla*

We created a function to compare the player scores against one another and used it to sort players in the array from highest score to lowest score.

````javascript
function compare(a, b) {
  if (a is less than b by some ordering criterion) {
    return -1;
  }
  if (a is greater than b by the ordering criterion) {
    return 1;
  }
  // a must be equal to b
  return 0;
}
````

### R E F L E C T I O N S

+ Using a fixed px value for HTML elements while formatting in CSS prevents consistent positioning between browsers and devices. Percentages can be used instead of pixels to sort thing out.
