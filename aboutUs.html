          <h3>Aloysious</h3>
          <p>Info about Kassie Detailzzzzzzz about Aloysious The fake report card: I failed the first quarter of a class
            in middle school, so I made a fake report card. I did this every quarter that year. I forgot that they mail
            home the end-of-year cards, and my mom got it before I could intercept with my fake. She was IRATE-about the
            school for their error. The teacher also retired that year and had already thrown out his records, so they
            had to take my mother’s “proof” (the fake ones I made throughout the year) and “correct” the “mistake.” I’ve
            never told her the truth.</p>
