## Team Agreement

## Communication plan:

+ Communicating outside of class hours: Slack group chat
+ To ensure everyone’s voice is being heard: at the beginning AND end of class time, each person will speak of what they are working on, how they’re feeling about the project/process in general.
+ To ensure we’re creating a safe space where everyone feels comfortable speaking up: We acknowledge that we have different comfort levels with different subjects and skills - we will try to respect everyone’s comfort zones and also recognize that we are all practicing working outside of our zones as well.

## Conflict plan:

> We are all in agreement that this group is a safe place.

1. If there is an issue between individuals, it will be brought up between them first.

+ If resolution is not reached, it will then be brought to the group’s attention.
+ After that, if there is not adequate resolution we will bring it to the attention of someone outside the group - i.e. Ryan or a TA

2. If there’s an issue in the group, it is a safe place to bring the issue to the group.

+ If adequate resolution is not reached, we will bring in someone from outside the group - i.e. an instructor or TA

## Git Process

+ The majority of our project will live in GitHub. Our project and our project board, as well as any other assets to be used in our project (photos, slideshow presentation)
+ The repository will be created and all members will be included as collaborators.
+ To review individual workflow members will send a slack message and clarify when work is done/going to be done
+ Clarify which branch is having work done
+ Notify in Slack when a PR is created
+ 2 people other than creator review PR before merge
+ Leave comment on PR and/or Slack message to say it's done
